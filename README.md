There are several steps you can take to make your application highly available across the globe using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here are some key considerations:

**1.Use Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This helps ensure that your application is always available, even if one of the AZs experiences an outage.**

**2.Use Amazon Route 53 to enable global traffic management, which allows you to route traffic to the optimal location based on factors such as network performance, geography, and health of your resources.**

**3.Use Amazon CloudFront to deliver your static and dynamic content with low latency and high data transfer speeds. CloudFront integrates with ELB or ALB to enable global content delivery.**
Use Amazon DynamoDB for your database needs. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

**4.Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance and availability of your resources. CloudWatch allows you to set alarms and automatically take corrective action when issues arise.**

**5.Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to decouple your application components and enable them to scale independently. This can help improve the availability of your application by allowing it to continue functioning even if one component fails.**

**6.By following these steps, you can build a highly available application that can withstand failures and continue to serve your users no matter where they are located.**
